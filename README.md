## Description

Voron 2.4 Gantry Wiper / Rest redesign derived from the excellent work @igannakas (Discord) pioneered to eliminate colour contamination when changing / purging filaments during mmu prints (https://www.printables.com/model/882364-adjustable-gantry-mounted-nozzle-seal-parking-and).<br />

  - [x] Dovetail sliders to make it easier to adjust, improve rigidity and reduce mounting hardware (2 x SHCS/BHCS M3 8mm, 2 x m3 washers, & 2 x M3 Heatsets)
  - [x] Internal voids to improve rigidity - 0.1mm 2x voids in arm & mount
  - [x] Height adjustable and replacable silicon nozzle rest
